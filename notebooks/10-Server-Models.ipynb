    "* Problem:  concurrent connections. How to process them\n",
    "* One solution is single thread/process:\n",
    "  - Block on multiple sockets. This is possible but hard to\n",
    "    write and maintain\n",
    "* We can create a concurrent agent per connection. Workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Process per connection\n",
    "1. Thread per connection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread per connection\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s.listen(10)\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    ns,peer = s.accept()\n",
    "    t = Thread(target=service, args=(ns,...))\n",
    "    t.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Threads are light\n",
    "* Already shared data. Creating a shared object is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* GIL cannot utilize multiple processes (specific to Python)\n",
    "* Resource limits apply to process, all threads share them (file descriptors, memory, CPU, stack)\n",
    "* Bugs causing exceptions and memory leakage in one thread will affect all connections\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process per connection\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s.listen(10)\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    ns,peer = s.accept()\n",
    "    t = Process(target=service, args=(ns,...))\n",
    "    t.start()\n",
    "    ns.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Shared data should be on shared memory. Use `Value, Array, Queue, Manager,..` for shared information. \n",
    "* IPC synchronization is more expensive.\n",
    "* Creating a process is more expensive. Memory, starting cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Each connection has independent resources\n",
    "* Each connection can get only its exceptions and errors. Others isolated.\n",
    "* Python can use multiple processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we need to put an upper bound. What if we like to get rid of startup cost for threads and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pool based services\n",
    "\n",
    "We create threads/processes in advance. They serve multiple connections. Reuse service objects for multiple connections. Increase #of conections that can be handled in a short period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also it is possible to grow and shrink number of processes/threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Service(Process):\n",
    "    def __init__(self,sock,...):\n",
    "        self.sock = sock\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",

    "            while True:\n",
    "                ns, peer = self.sock.accept()\n",
    "                echoservice(ns)\n",
    "                # connection over, ready to get next connection\n",

    "s=socket(AF_INET,...)\n",
    "s.bind(.;..)\n",

    "\n",
    "poolsize = 40\n",
    "pool = [Service(s) for i in range(poolsize)]\n",
    "for p in pool:\n",
    "    p.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* If initialization cost is significant with respect to responsiveness of your protocol, creating a thread/process per connection is too expensive. so create in advance and reuse existing threads/processes will be more practical."
